🤖 Simple Rule-Based Chatbot

A console-based chatbot application developed using Python that interacts with users through predefined rules and intent recognition.
This project demonstrates the basic working of conversational systems without using machine learning or NLP models.

The Simple Rule-Based Chatbot simulates a conversational agent that can:

Respond to greetings

Handle help requests

Perform small talk

Answer basic domain-related questions

Exit the conversation gracefully

The chatbot works entirely on predefined rules, without using machine learning models.

📌 Project Description

The Simple Rule-Based Chatbot responds to user input using pattern matching and conditional logic.

It is designed to understand common user intents such as greetings, help requests, small talk, and exit commands.

This project was developed as part of an internship task to strengthen fundamentals of Python and conversational AI.

🎯 Objectives

 -Understand chatbot fundamentals

-Implement rule-based conversation logic

-Practice Python conditional statements

-Build interactive console applications

⚙️ Features

✔ Intent recognition (greetings, help, exit)
✔ Rule-based responses
✔ Small built-in knowledge base
✔ Interactive command-line interface
✔ Error-free execution in online & local environments

🧠 How It Works

1.User enters a message in the console

2.Input is converted to lowercase

3.The chatbot checks predefined rules using if-elif-else

4.If a match is found, the corresponding response is returned

5.If no rule matches, a default response is shown

6.Conversation continues until the user types exit / bye / quit
